      "I first heard about this watch on the Poor Man's Watch site. I found it on Amazon.com. I then performed a product review by reading these types of reviews and then I ordered the watch. It arrived in less than seven days. there were no S/H fees or taxes. I paid $79.00 which included a beautiful box, cleaning cloth, warranty and instruction. By the way the box alone is probably worth the money I paid for the watch and yes on some sites, it is advertisted and you are given the impression that it is a separate cost item that does not come with the watch. The price on this site was the lowest price I've found for this watch.Now here is the good part: This watch is an extraordinary value for this price or higher, (much higher). The quality of the bracelet and case is wonderful. the watch has a Japanese automatic movement not a Swiss movement and has been keeping very good time since I've had it (less than a 30 second gain in a week) with constant wear and the sweep second hand is fluid but not 28,000+/- bph. The hands and dial were very bright after exposure to the light and stayed that way all night. The front and rear crystals are real sapphire, the beautiful braclet is part brush and part polish stainless steel. The polish portion of the band is beautiful but I would supspect that it might scar after some period of wear. However I've knock against it several times without any noticeable affect. I had several links taken out of this watch at a local watch kiosk in the mall. I asked the owner to exchange the original link pins with new ones since I heard that the original watch pins were ineffective in maintaining the integrity of the bracelet once it/they were removed and replaced back in the watch. Upon the watch dealer's examination he told me that it wasn't necessary to exchange the pins because the existing link pins had a feature found on better made watches that prevented their slippage. He showed me the pins and thier spring like locking mechanism before he reinstalled them. However for peace of mind I had him put a drop of supper glue on each pin...smile.I have several more expensive watches but I really have fallen in love with this watch. For the price you can't find a more solid, seeming durable, functional and handsome new automatic watch anywhere for the price. Amazon was great to deal with and if you can get this watch for the same price, better or even at a higher price then you better do it soon. As I said the watch box is more durable and more beautiful than many others that I seen. I hope this helps.\n"
