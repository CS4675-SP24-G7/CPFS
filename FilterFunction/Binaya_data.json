      "title": "Great Starter PC - for work and gaming!",
      "content": "If you\u2019re researching and scouring the internet for advice on what starter PC you should invest in, you\u2019ve found the review you need. I spent months looking for a decent starter PC which would allow me to play all my games and  store my content effectively while maintaining speed and quality.  I wanted something that was visually appealing and functional. Personally, I\u2019m a broke college kid who needed an outlet to balance school and fun. I wasn\u2019t sure where to begin my search, and had no idea what requirements and features were required to have an effective and quality PC. In this review, I\u2019m putting you in the same position as me when I started looking through the PC marketplace. When beginning the search for your first PC, the search can be incredibly overwhelming and daunting. However, you are doing an amazing job searching if the internet miraculously placed you with this item. Let\u2019s break down the features of the PC. This computer is a pre-built, which means there is no assembly required on your part. There\u2019s a plethora of components that make a PC worth buying, and I\u2019m going to break down the specifics of each component and how they correlate to the performance and quality of your gaming. The primary function of any PC is the central processing unit (CPU). The CPU, also known as the processor, is responsible for executing and refining the power of the computer and directly affects how fast your computer, or computer games, run. The CPU also processes the inputs from the user. The CPU included in this pre-built is an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 3rd Generation. Another important factor in the PC is the RAM. RAM stands for random access memory. The purpose of RAM is to store short term data and allow the computer to process applications properly. RAM\u2019s data is temporarily stored while applications are currently operating, like having a game playing. This PC includes an 8 GB card, which means if your game requires around 8 GB of RAM, your game will function and run properly. If you\u2019re not sure about a game\u2019s required RAM, the developers include those requirements in the breakdown and analytics of each game. The RAM only holds the contents of the game for the duration you are playing. Once the application is shut off, the RAM is no longer active. While RAM is temporary storage, the hard drive processor is not. The hard drive is responsible for keeping your saved digital storage. For example, the space required for saving your game or Microsoft Office software. The hard drive also stores pictures, videos, and the applications you have downloaded on your PC. Hard drives can be external or internal, which means saving data to an external memory device or to the PC itself, and the contents can be deleted or cleared once you no longer need them. The hard drive included in this pre-built is a 500 GB SSD card.You can store up to 500 gigabytes of content as soon as you start up the PC. While those features are required for every PC, even for basic processes and storage, this review will highlight the rest of the features through a gaming perspective since this is a gaming PC. The graphics card is responsible for rendering the images and content in a game and running them effectively. It renders the movements, animations, inputs, and images that are in a game through a series of fast acting calculations completed internally in the PC. The graphics card included in this PC is a GeForce GTX 1660 Ti 6G GDDR5, which holds 6 GB of RAM. If you are a little confused about whether or not your graphics card is going to make or break your gaming experience, multiple YouTube creators offer a compilation of benchmark videos with clips and segments from video games with demanding animation and experiences. The benchmark videos include multiple different video games from varying genres that allow gamers to evaluate how well the game is running and performing according to the graphics card. In regard to usability and functionality of the PC, the developers include a detailed pamphlet that illustrates how to properly connect your PC to a monitor, how to enable your microphone and speakers, and the purpose of each feature throughout the PC. The PC does require a three-prong plug, and I recommend plugging the cord into a direct power source, like a wall outlet, instead of a surge protector or extension cord. When plugging in a monitor, there are two different HDMI ports on the back of the PC for up to 2 different monitors to be used simultaneously. Computer speakers should have a USB port to plug into the back of the PC, and headsets unfortunately require a splitter to listen to music and use a microphone concurrently. Splitters are cords that connect to the aux section of your headphone cord, and it divides this cord into two auxiliaries that can be plugged into two corresponding holes. The PC permits one USB powered keyboard and one USB mouse. These assets are included in the Amazon listing. This PC in particular is incredibly visually appealing.  It features a white tower, which is the casing around all the important parts of the PC, with a tempered glass window on the side to look into the tower. It also has multiple RGB lights and various functions. There are seven varying lighting functions to encourage individuality and styles. Located around the lighting fixtures are three fans to cool the system down. The fans blend in with the circular lighting fixtures. The PC is very cohesive in design, and incorporates each feature into the overall aesthetic of the computer. Overall, I believe this PC is a quality starter PC within its budget of $1200. It strives in multi-tasking, allowing the user to edit documents while having a YouTube video or music running in the background. I have been using this system for school and gaming for around eight months, and have had no issues with it. I give it an A for price point, functionality, and visual appeal. I believe this is an ideal PC for a casual gamer who wants something to balance work and entertainment with.",

      "content": "(I got the model with a 4060 in it.) I mean, what is there to say? A 4060, a 1TB SSD, 16G RAM and a decent CPU? For under $900?! I didn't really have money for a gaming PC, but when I saw this deal I had to make it work, because who doesn't want to save like $1k! This thing runs smooth as silk. I had a gaming laptop with a 2070 in it that couldn't do Cyberpunk at better than 12 frames/sec at some parts, without reducing the graphics quality to crap. Not so this machine - I can even turn on some of the RTX features and it still runs great (note that I'm more of a high-quality at ~30fps, than a 60fps-or-die guy). I'm running Oculus and SteamVR apps through to my (first-gen) Meta Quest headset, and that works great too. And no matter how badass a game I'm putting it through, the fans are whisper-quiet. You can hear them, and you can hear that they ramp up to deal with increased performance - but it's _very_ quiet and unobtrusive. I wasn't expecting this, but it came with a keyboard and mouse, too, which saved me the trouble of digging through the junk in my house to find some (I've been focusing on laptops for a while up to now). The keyboard is solid-quality mechanical, too - nothing too amazing, but not shabby. The mouse feels lightweight and cheap, but works well, and both are lit up with multicolor LEDs so yay. The WiFi antennae that came with my system was a single-form, boxy looking thing, with a magnet in it to keep it place on the chassis (if you like). It doesn't at all resemble the pair of standard \"rod\" antennae that were shown in my quickstart guide, so at first I was concerned that it didn't have them. But it did, it just has an unexpected shape. Look for the small coaxial chords, rather than a particular shape, and you'll find it handily enough. I should say, the first time I tested the machine out on some high-power games, I was initially disappointed. But I think there were a lot of background downloading and disk storage things happening. Apparently my Steam wasn't set not to download in the background, but even when it wasn't downloading, I think Windows was, and it was chewing up performance (one of the things I really dislike about gaming on a PC vs a console). After I had the PC a couple days longer, performance was way, way better than my initial (amateur) tests. Might also have helped to, you know, run updates on drivers and the OS and such. Happy gaming!",

      "content": "This is the first pre-built system I've purchased in almost 20 years, I've always built my own. On to computer... Keep in mind, I'm not a heavy gamer... At first, the fans were running full blast all the time. I couldn't see the RPM in the BIOS to adjust them, I re-seated the one cable that runs to the fan controller on the motherboard, booted it back up and there it was. I don't know if it wasn't seated properly or just \"one of those things\" but it fixed the issue and I was able to adjust them. All good now. Video card and motherboard were Asus, I've never had issues with them, some people hate them, some love them, to each their own. The SSD (M.2) was WD green, 1 TB and a gold certified power supply, generic name but it's running quiet and no issues. I couldn't have built this piece by piece for close to their price here on Amazon. The case is solid and the lights are pretty. If you want to play games at a higher resolution than 1920x1080, you will need to adjust the game settings accordingly.",

      "title": "Great system for 1080p gaming.",
      "content": "TLDR: Highly recommended for anyone who wants to play current gen games at 1080p. Great value and decent parts! Its been 84 years since I last set foot... well it feels that long since I was last in the market for a new gaming rig. I'm upgrading from a 9 year old Cyberpowerpc-amd phenom-gtx960 build (RIP). Long overdue for an upgrade. I didn't recognize the Skytech brand so I looked at some amazon reviews, their website, and the Better Business Bureau. Come to find out they are new  company (1yr old) and not accredited at the BBB. So, I read some more reviews at the BBB site. Most of the negative reviews were people that were impatient waiting for tech support or frustrated with the rma process and bummed about having a brick. One thing that I noticed was that all of the complaints lodged against them (there were 3) were resolved. I decided to take a chance on them. The package came 1 day ahead of schedule which was nice. But, when I saw the condition of the packaging I was concerned. It looked like Wolverine had slashed the top of the box (check out the pic). When I opened the package everything seemed well placed and secured. The first thing I noticed on this machine was the side tempered glass panel. It works on a hinge and magnet system which is super convenient and easy to access. Once I unpacked everything and took out the expanding foam that wraps the components (carefully), I checked all of the power and data connections. Everything was plugged in and snug but i noticed that the cable management was very tight, especially under the shroud where the power supply is. There is a 3.5 in HDD bay down there that is going to be difficult to access because it's partially blocked by the cables. Other than that the cable management is clean enough. The keyboard and mouse were umm... usable... Ive definitely had worse. I checked all of the components to make sure my device matched my product description, everything seemed good. I was a little worried because the video card looked smaller than I expected. Turns out that it is a PNY single fan card, smaller than most 1660 Supers but seems to be up to par. Next I crossed my fingers and hit the power button. First there were lights... beautiful RGB goodness coming from 3 case fans and the front panel. Next, the ASRock boot screen (Almost there). Finally the Windows setup screen and a sigh of relief. Windows setup went well, no issues. Startup after initial setup takes less than 20 seconds. I ran NZXT Cam software to get some info on the components and monitor cpu/gpu loads and temps. Idle temps are normal and the case seems to have good airflow. I can play RDR2 at 1080p at a solid 60fps with mostly high/ultra settings, I had to lower the water quality and reflections to keep above 60 frames. Other games that I tried out were COD Warzone, Doom Eternal, Borderlands 3, R6, Fortnite, DBD, CSGO and others. It ran all of them at med-high settings. I'm very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend Skytech Gaming.",

      "title": "Easy to use & Easy to setup",
      "content": "To start off, this is a review on the item: Manufacturer Part#: ST-NEBULA-0819-B-AM Processor: INTEL Core i5 13400F 2.5 GHz (4.6GHz Max Boost) CPU Memory: 16GB DDR4 RAM 3200 Gaming Memory with Heat Spreader Video Card: NVIDIA Geforce RTX 4060 8GB GDDR6X Graphics Card (Brand may vary) SSD: 1TB NVME SSD Operating System: Microsoft windows 11 Home 64-bit Case: Skytech Nebula Gaming Case, Black WiFi: 802.11AC Fans: 4 RGB Fans for Maximum Air Flow This PC so far has been great for gaming as well as working from home. The functionality right out of the box has been great and it has been a breeze to get setup. The PC has a folder that comes with it and it shows the step by step guide on how to setup your machine as well as how to troubleshoot if need be. There are many Pro's and few Con's so far since I have owned the Machine. Pros: Packaging for shipping was over the top on making sure it was coming to me securely, Comes as described with little setup needed, Performance has been stellar, Quiet Machine and fans, Case has great airflow, Quality of the product is over the top for the price of this machine. Operates many games on ULTRA settings with 0 issues. Cons: The machine comes with 16gb of DDR4 ram installed and this is a great starter amount but for full potential I would recommend upgrading to the minimum of 32gb of DDR4 or higher.(I upgraded to 32gb DDR4 3200mhz with the 4 available slots) One of the Ram sticks seemed to be not fully clipped into position but took minor adjustment to get setup. The rear fan was loose and rubbing against the case which had a small clicking noise but was an easy fix. Trouble connecting the DisplayPort to a Monitor after trying multiple cords, but HDMI does work well. Cord management inside could be much better, the cables seem to block some of the ports for the RAM and would recommend using some zip-ties to hold them out of the way. Games: GTA-V - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPS Fortnite - Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPS Battlefield 2042 -  Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPS War Thunder -  Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPS Minecraft -  Runs at highest settings with 0 issues and high FPS Can handle many applications open on multiple monitors when working from home such as, Tableau, Excel, Zoom, Teams, Talend, PowerPoint, Multiple query applications (Coding with no issues), Video editing, Streaming. The PC at the price point is worth the purchase, after doing many researches without wanting to build my own PC this was the best Pre-Built machine money can find. Many have i5-13400F processors with 3060's or lower processors with similar 4060/3060's for more cost. At $850 USD this machine will tackle most of what you will need to do unless you're into heavy editing or a big streamer or using extreme applications. This PC is great for overall use.",

      "title": "Solid Prebuilt with Room to Upgrade Later (Parts Listed in Review)",
      "content": "So, this prebuilt comes with MB - ASRock B660M-C - $90 GPU - Zotac Gaming RTX 4060 - $300 CPU - i5 13400F - $200 CPU (COOLER) - Generic with RGB - $20-50 SSD - m.2 MSI m371 Gen 3 SSD - $40 RAM - 16gb DDR4 3200 CL16 (Gammix D10 w/ heatsink) - $60 PSU - Gamdias Helios P1 600W (80+ Gold) - Proprietary and Not Rated (est $50-60) The Case has 4 RGB Fans (very quiet) - $40-75 and then you have to get windows and build it... so the total here would be roughly $800-850 before tax, same as the prebuilt.  While I can appreciate that it is basically a wash and you aren't really paying much for the labor or the shipping, with that said I think they could easily have went with a better mb and a faster ssd combo, gen 3 is way outdated by this point, and the psu has no online information at all really which can be a bit alarming, however with the components in this pc you aren't pushing anywhere near the limit, maybe running at 50-65% of the 600w so it should be fine. The pc is clean and well managed cable wise, however any time you go with a micro atx board in a mid size tower, the cables will always look a little ugly in comparison to a full board to fit the size of the case.  The flip side of that is that the case has a ton of room for expanding or upgrading later and the airflow is impressive.  The RGB requires software and the button on the case (front/top) is useless.  Overall though the build quality is pretty solid, plus you get a folder in the box that contains some information on troubleshooting, a quality inspection sheet with the signature and name of the employee that built your pc and they even give you a business card with a contact number, should you need help.  Top notch as far as that goes. It was packaged really well with a ton of internal foam and padding to keep the gpu and all safe during the delivery, the box was secured well within the shipping box and no damage could be seen, I did a visual inspection of the cables and all, everything was secured well to the Motherboard, they get a solid grade for the actual build. Thus far I've played Fortnite at nearly 200 fps and I've played through robocop on Epic settings with DLSS enabled, getting well above 60 fps even in the outdoor environments, in closed off levels it pushes over 100 fps, I also played Alan Wake 2 on High Preset with DLSS enabled both with and without Frame Gen on and either way is absolutely playable, and if you lowered it to medium, which is still above what you'd get on a PS5 you will easily stay well over 60 more around 80 fps in the toughest areas for the GPU to handle and pushing near 100 during the lighter workloads in game.  I am blown away at what this little 4060 in here can do when paired with fast ddr4 ram and a solid CPU, while playing the CPU is never pushed even to half its workload, and the temps inside are super cool (even with discord and obs running at the same time).  The airflow and cooling are very good with this build.  (I am gaming at 1080p btw) Anyway I hope this helps for those of you out there considering this one for the holiday, I think its a solid pc and so far, its super snappy for everything Ive done, while I'd like to have seen a gen 4 ssd and a more universal power supply inside, really for what this thing costs, you just cannot complain too much about that.  Corners will have to be cut to get the price to where it is and again you could likely build the same pc with your own parts and case for about $825-900, the convenience of having it done by a professional and coming with a warranty is just too nice to pass up sometimes.  If you don't feel like building your own and you have a budget of about $900 it honestly does not seem like too bad a way to go.  It has tons of processing power for multitasking, and the GPU can do some good work at 1080p.  Very satisfied with the pc, hoping the quality holds up over time. Happy Holidays everyone, good luck with your purchase or if you build, good luck with that as well!",

      "title": "Love it!",
      "content": "I definitely recommend this desktop. It arrived sooner than it was supposed to. It is very quiet. Seriously I thought it was dead on arrival because it was so quiet I was convinced it was not powering on. I could see the lights and the fans were moving, but couldn\u2019t hear that hard drive sound, and fans were quieter than a cotton ball dropping on the ground. I have a brand new monitor and it was saying no signal. I had plugged the monitor into the wrong HDMI port. Once I figured that out, I could see that the computer was working lol. It\u2019s very fast. The graphics are very crisp. My set up instructions were not in the box and I emailed Skytech and they responded in about 48 hours. Considering I emailed them on Easter, I was impressed with that response time. There was a flyer attached to the inside of the computer that said if the set up instructions are not included, please go to this website and I was able to do that and set up my computer before they responded. The only issue I\u2019ve had is the LED lights. I cannot turn them off. I could also not change the color of them. I have emailed customer service about it and see if they have an idea of how to troubleshoot. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker if I can\u2019t turn them on and off. They are on. it doesn\u2019t impact my gaming, which is what I bought it for. UPDATE customer service emailed me back same day and told me I should try holding the LED button for three seconds release it and then immediately press it. This did not resolve my issue but the reset button next to the LED button when I pressed and held it for three seconds released and pressed again it did reset the lights. And they are now working properly they were working before I just couldn\u2019t turn them off or change the pattern or the colors. There are a lot of options for colors and patterns. I was also able to find a video on YouTube about the keyboard changing the colors. The keyboard has limited options for colors and patterns, but they can be changed a little bit. I\u2019m averaging 100+ fps. I have a lot of startup processes that load anytime I\u2019ve rebooted the computer, and it takes seconds for everything to get up and running. I have a razor mouse and anybody who\u2019s ever used the synapses knows that it can sometimes slow machine down on reboot. Pleased to report it does not do so anymore. I also have discord, battlenet, nvidia graphics app, curse forge, and several other programs that start up. It takes under a minute for everything to load at start up for me to be in game. I\u2019d like to point out but I played for several days with the original 16gb RAM and I have since upgraded to 64gb. There really is no need to upgrade the ram. There is no performance difference for me between the two as far as gaming goes. Not that I could visually see while playing the game. I was going to upgrade to 32 GB, but the 64 was on sale. And sometimes I do video rendering so I thought why not. Also, there are other companies out there with similar names to skyTech gaming, they appear to be sending customers to Skytech gaming for customer service issues and they are not part of Skytech gaming. So just be mindful if you see bad reviews elsewhere that there are a couple of other companies using skytech gaming customer service number as their own customer service number. For the price and the value I definitely recommend. I have seen a few questions about Ram. Mine came with two 8GB sticks. There are four slots total available. I do have more ram coming that I\u2019ve ordered.",

The wife's is nice and quiet but mine sounds like an xbox 360 loading GTA. No fan control in the BIOS or preloaded software (SignalRGB, GCC) on the one I am using. I highly recommend disabling GCC as the SignalRGB works best to control fan lights and speed(on one of them anyway) and gives easy to use UI with trackable PC data for temps across the board. GCC bugs out even after installing latest updates(on both pcs) If I could get a hold of customer support to figure out the fan thing it would be 5 stars top to bottom.",

I had almost a hard time setting it up, it doesnt come with instructions but its on the website. To me it wasnt very helpful and it came with two extra wires and i lack a bit of knowledge when it comes to this, this is my first pc. I had to go to their discord to ask what the wires were for because it didnt say on the website, i got it figured out tho. Got a bit confused when it didnt connect with my monitor because there were two different places to put HDMI cables, but i got that taken care of, i just didnt fully understand the instructions on the website. Ive had the pc for about a week now and many games on it and it works amazing! The keyboard tho... its very bulky and i dont like it personally so im buying a new one soon, the mouse is fine, at one point the keyboard wasn't working on the pc and i was worried about it for a second before unplugging and plugging back in, thankfully thats all i had to do i really thought it was broken already \ud83d\ude2d but thats the only issue ive ever had to far. The fans are only noisy when you first turn on the power and play powerful games but then quiet down. The 1TB of storage is great but im more worried about the other storage, doesn't really keep up with the main storage? Its in the picture, like i said i lack a little knowledge but not with computers in general but i dont understand this part. But in the end i really really do like this pc and i hope it lasts long for me.",

      "content": "Day 3 Review, 4.5/5 Stars This Skytech PC shipped very quickly, is very clean, and arrived with all advertised components.  Having done some comparative shopping, I settled on this model, and after the first few days of using it, I am completely satisfied, with just a couple of things to be aware of, mentioned below. Pros: * Very tight and clean build, with a lot internal case space to spare. * Shipped very quickly, using Amazon Prime's free shipping. * Competitive pricing for the included parts - RAM, SSD, Motherboard and Graphics Card. * More than capable of handling any of today's games, or multi-tasking for business. * Comes with LED gaming keyboard and mouse. * LEDs are synced between the case fans (which you can see through the clear glass side panel), and the front panel of the case.  A button on the case lets you cycle between colors (or turn them off). Cons: * The included motherboard is small.  There are 2 RAM slots, and if you use the included WiFi card, there are no additional slots for more PCIe components.  To upgrade the RAM, you will have to replace an existing card, rather than just adding to what is already included. * In my build, the graphics card and WiFi cards are so close together, that when I first turn on the PC, there is a rattle sound, as the graphics cards' fan vibration makes the card tap against the WiFi card.  In my case, this goes away after settling for a few seconds, and the PC is very quiet afterward. * If you want to install a disk drive (not SSD), you will have to do some digging.  There is not an available mount directly inside the case. The parts are essentially of the 2019 generation.  You may be able to find another model with a graphics card that is newer.  However, at the time of this writing, I was unable to find a better overall purchase for the price on Amazon or any other site, and I believe this is and will be fully capable of playing any games released for several years to come.",

This pc is great, I set it up in about an hour with little to no issues. I love the RGB on the keyboard, mouse, and of course pc, it looks great. I play games like ts4, genshin impact, and adventuring/3d platforming games (think spyro, crash bandicoot, etc) and this works like a dream for them. The loudest I\u2019ve heard it get it is a mellow purr that honestly just sounded like my AC lol! And yes, the keyboard set up having the enter button all huge and the backspace being very small is pretty awkward but it really isn\u2019t a big deal once you get used to it. The mouse is also really comfortable and it didn\u2019t take barely any time to get used to how it felt in my hand. The shipping was also FAST. Like- I ordered it on a Tuesday expecting it to come at the earliest the following week but it came on a Friday! Plus, the box and everything wasn\u2019t all beat up which is always a plus. I really can\u2019t say much else for now, as I\u2019ve only been using this pc for a few hours now, but I\u2019ll try and update this review over time to see how it holds up. But for now, from an entry-level and casual gamer I can say this is very much worth the price.",

I sent an email to customer support and they helped me cancel that order and purchase this model. So it was a nice buying experience. When I got the computer I was impressed by how it looks inside, clean with a lot of space. I also bought a 2 TB HDD and installing it was a breeze. If you want to install an HDD, there is a space for it next to the power supply, on the other side of the tempered glass. There is bracket for it there, like in my picture. You only need an extra SATA cable for that. At first I was impressed by how neatly all the cables were back there but I had to cut a zip tie that held a bundle of cables to use one of them to power the HDD. That's when I took that picture, and not after that did I realize that this company included several extra zipties you can use to put them back neatly. That was very impressive, and I think that they did a good job in allowing the buyer to add an extra storage device, because there is also an unused slot for an SDD in the front(glass side). Boot up was easy, it was just Windows so overall I give this 5 stars. Just keep in mind I've only had it a couple days but if nothing changes this will remain 5 stars.",

Build quality is phenomenal for casual gaming and I\u2019ve played some graphically demanding games on the thing but it just keeps on trucking. The Two complaints I have are the amount of storage space is not enough for my gaming habits and the computer will not connect to 5G Wi-Fi on its own. I had to buy another SSD, and I had to buy a Wi-Fi adapter to be able to connect to 5G. Wi-Fi adapters are very cheap though, so not much harm done. If 500GB is enough for you then ignore this complaint. Other than that, the pc runs perfect out of the box and setup was easy. The price is fine, but I recommend waiting for it to go on sale. I\u2019ve had this PC since around September and after ironing out those two bugs, I would say you\u2019ve got a quality pc on your hands.",

      "content": "In the gaming community there is a lot of 'gate keeping' when it comes to buying/building PCs. However, there is nothing wrong with buying a prebuilt if you - like me - don't have time to build this. I have absolutely ADORED this PC so far. It runs amazing, is relatively quiet, and is super easy to set up and get playing. They do an amazing job packaging this PC to make sure that it won't be broken in delivery and nearly all the wires when I went to check them were already plugged in. I haven't had any problems with this PC so far and do not foresee any problems. I primarily play CS:GO, Valorant, League of Legends, WoW, Modded/Vanilla Minecraft, Overwatch, and Among Us and this PC runs them smoothly and at a good FPS. **I do recommend getting a different mouse and keyboard if you do not have one already. The focus of this purchase is the prebuilt itself and that's why the review is 5 stars. However, in terms of the keyboard and mouse I very much think they are of poor quality and rather loud. This is no problem for my youngest brother who is just glad to have a light of keyboard, but if you are looking for a quality gaming keyboard it is a sad excuse.",

I had AMD FX 6300 that bottle necked entirely. I could get by in games but a lot of lag here and there. BOY I GOTTA SAY this computer is a whole another level. Everything is so snappy , responsive and can handle practically any game at a high setting. I feel like I utilized my 144hz monitor to its maximum. The case is what really shocked me. The case is so well made, all the ports are in great spots and  the fans are sooooo quiet.  They even threw in some pretty decent mouse and keyboard along with it. I love the dust filter above the fans to protect the inside. I'm just having so much fun playing every game now. It's a whole new experience.  Streaming takes no hit on frames or anything either. I'm just super happy with this. I'm sure some many find cons with it but I came from hell on my old set up so I honestly can't see it. I would highly recommend it. To top it off they package the computer nicely and well protected. If theres anything you feel you want to upgrade, there's plenty of space. There's also a place for a m.2 SSD.",

The keyboard that came with it had a slight issue of the space bar sticking, so I just bought a replacement keyboard since I wanted a white anyway. The mouse was cool and worked great, but again, I swapped it out for a white one. The PC itself has no issues at all, and I even spilled iced coffee on it like a week or two into getting it and the filter on top saved it from pouring straight in. Some did get on the components inside but I was able to kill the power and clean it out with rubbing alcohol and it still works perfectly! Now I do not bring drinks or liquids near it. Anyway, I bought this for the graphics card and it did not disappoint. Games look AMAZING running on this thing, and I am so happy with my purchase. Definitely recommend!",

The only (really minor complaint) is that there is a mount for a second solid state drive but it lacks the screws that are supposed to be with it.  The computers are well built, well protected during shipping, and the cases are very durable as well as pretty (side bonus). They are neatly put together.  You do have to have a cd/dvd drive of your own as it does not come with one.  I just picked up a little usb 20 dollar one to go with it.  The first computer I got that has very slightly lower specs to this one, plays the new flight simulator game well, on a 4k monitor.  I would say if you are a gamer, you may want to plan to add a secondary drive sooner than later due to the size of the new games, but most gamers already know this/have one anyway.  There are enough slots to add up to a total of 4 drives altogether.",

I do love this computer and it fits all my needs even makes photo editing and video editing so much easier. Worth the money and as the pc gets outdated it will be easy to get new parts to replace so in the long run you will be saving money.  I gave them 5 stars for tech support because I bought my husband a new computer from there site very similar to this one but with a black tower, and the windows wasnt loading properly, the tech guy that helped me made is super easy and was so patient. I will definitely recommend skytech gaming to my friends and family.",

Lots of USB access.  Overall extremely satisfied with this machine, I did not need to contact Tech support for anything.  Comes well packaged, and was fully intact upon delivery.  This runs all the games I play at least 80FPS on ultra settings at 1080p.  The rainbow LED lights are a plus. The only downside to this machine is the 500GB SSD.  I purchased an additional 2TB HDD to install.  Upon installing the HDD, It was a little difficult to locate the power cable for the extra HDD.  Once I located the power cables, I noticed they are all very neatly tucked away and zip tied in the chassis of the tower.  Beware, if you purchase additional hard drives--pick up some SATA cables because the computer does not come with additional sata cables. League of Legends--165 FPS (my monitor's cap) GTA5--83FPS No Man's Sky--80+FPS Forza Horizon 4--80+FPS 5/5 stars for $1,000 computer.",

(other cool facts about it) it has around 6 USB 3.0 ports And its has 2 2.0 USB ports. It brought 2 antenna (apparently the antenna for the Wi-Fi is different for others since my friend bough the same one and had a  different one.) And something that I didn't knew, it comes with its own mouse and keyboard! overall, great pc for starters, seems easy to upgrade better components!",

I tried several headsets to no avail. I finally asked a friend for help and was told that there were no drivers installed. Once we installed them and updated everything (with some updates for the computer being last updated in the mid 2000s), the sound finally worked. Unfortunately there is a whishing sound that both my friends and I hear when playing due to the fans in the tower. That is the only complaint. Games look great, videos look great. The tower comes with a wireless card if you don't use a direct connection. I have never had issues with overheating either, even with 8 straight hours of use. Would buy again!",
